### Practical open science approaches to salmon data management, analysis, and synthesis

This series of three training events in Alaska will present open and practical approaches
for using open science to advance understanding and management of salmon
in Alaska.  Workshops will focus on open data science techniques, and will cover
topics in data management, data modeling, data sharing and preservation, reproducible 
analysis and synthesis, and visualization, among others.

The events will target researchers, managers, students, and community members with
an interest in improving their skills in data science, data sharing, and 
reproducible research.  The events will be developed for faculty and
students from the UAF Fisheries Department, the Alaska Department of Fish and
Game, the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, and other agencies and community
members.  Each training event will target a specific community, and open calls for
registration will be publicized before each event.
