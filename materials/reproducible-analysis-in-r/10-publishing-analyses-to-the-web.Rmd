# Publishing Analyses to the Web

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

- How to use git, GitHub (+Pages), and (R)Markdown to publish an analysis to the web

## Outline

[These are mainly notes for Bryce which will be removed at a later date]

Main goal: Participants will publish their hands-on activity as to GH Pages

Steps:

- [Pre] Participants will already have a repo on GitHub with, at least, an RMarkdown document in it
- Get the students to render their Rmd to HTML
- Preview locally
- Commit the change and push to GitHub
- Turn on GH Pages for the master branch on GitHub
- View the resulting URL
- Do another change
- Commit and push
- See result

Idealy, the RMd would have:

- Some prose
- One or more plots
- One map w/ Leaflet
