# Publishing Analyses to the Web

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

- How to use git, GitHub (+Pages), and (R)Markdown to publish an analysis to the web

## Outline

Sharing your work with others in engaging ways is an important part of the scientific process.
So far in this course, we've introduced a small set of powerful tools for doing open science:

- R and its many packages
- RStudio
- git
- GiHub
- RMarkdown

RMarkdown, in particular, is amazingly powerful for creating scientific reports but, so far, we haven't tapped its full potential for sharing our work with others.

In this lesson, we're going to take an existing GitHub repository and turn it into a beautiful and easy to read web page using the tools listed above.

### Minimal example

- Locate the local copy of the GitHub repository you created yesteray in the git/GitHub lesson

    We're going to modify this repository by turning on GitHub Pages and knitting and commiting RMarkdown files rendered as HTML
  
- Add a new file at the top level called `index.Rmd`
- Open `index.Rmd` (if it isn't already open)
- Press Knit

    Observe the renderd output
    Notice the new file in the same directory `index.html`.
    This is our RMarkdown file rendered as HTML (a web page)
- Commit your changes (to both index.Rmd and index.html)
- Open your web browser to the GitHub.com page for your repository
- Go to Settings > GitHub Pages and turn on GitHub Pages for the `master` branch

    Now, the rendered website version of your repo will show up at a special URL.
    
    GitHub Pages follows a convention like this:
    
     ![github pages url pattern](images/github_pages.png)
     
    Note that it will no longer be at github.com but github.io
     
- Go to https://{username}.github.io/{repo_name}/ (Note the trailing `/`)
    Observe the awesome rendered output
    
   
    
Observing changes...

- Go back to our `index.Rmd`
- Delete all the content, except the YAML frontmatter
- Type "Hello world"
- Commit, push
- Go back to https://amoeba.github.io/rmd-test/

### Making it good

TODO

- Add some data
- Add a ggplot
- Add a leaflet map
