# RStudio and Git/GitHub Setup

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you will learn:

## Outline

Draft outline (Bryce jotting things down for others to see) (not complete):

- Get familiar RStudio
  - Using R Projects so you can be happy
  - How to structure your analysis in a folder
  
  The idea is that we don't wantt to teach just "how to use package X", we're teaching how to use packages together in an analysis.
  We'll need to talk about conventions for where stuff (R scripts, raw data, processed data) should go.
- Get Git and GitHub all set up
  - Walkthrough on git (very basic)
  - Get accounts on GitHub
