      <title>Fairbanks, Oct 2018: Reproducible analysis with R</title>
      <link>https://nceas.github.io/sasap-training/events/reproducible-analysis-fairbanks/</link>

      <description>Dates: October 16-17, 2018
Location: Fairbanks, AK
Venue: UAF, International Arctic Research Center, room 417
This event will cover techniques for building reproducible analysis workflows using the R programming language through a series of hands-on coding sessions. We will use examples from integrating salmon brood data across the state of Alaska to show how heterogeneous data can be cleaned, integrated, and documented through workflows written in RMarkdown. After an overview of the use of RMarkdown for literate analysis, we will dive into critical topics in data science, including version control, data modeling, cleaning, and integration, and then data visualization both for publications and the web.</description>
